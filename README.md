# Bangkit Academy 2023 - Cloud Computing
My learning journey in Bangkit Academy 2023
--

*16 Feb 2023*
Kampus merdeka national on-boarding
- The comment section become too riot

*17 Feb 2023*
Technical briefing and life path session
- We got welcomed by GoTo, Traveloka, and Bangkit Representatives. They explained about the program, rules, important infos, etc.
- On life path session, we're teached that we should know what is our purpose, our life choices, etc. when joining this program.
- My ultimate goal is certification, the incubation prize is just a bonus. Instead, the projects and portfolios itself are more important.
